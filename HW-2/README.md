# Summary
To summarize my work this week, I have:
-created a directory for week two's homework files
-within the week two, I created a readme.MD text file through Atom
-reviewed the entire week two assignment and information posted on the github class page about markdown text files
- {https://montana-media-arts.github.io/mart341-webDev/modules/week-2/markup/#hw2todo}
-reviewed the markdown cheat sheet to familiarize myself with the formatting and syntax of the specific file structure
-learned the process by which .DM files are committed in


## Steps to Completion
To fully understand the concepts being discussed during week two, I had to extensively read through the given information and re read a few times as I went.
====== The following are the steps I took to completing this weeks HW load======
1. Create the week two folder and readme.MD file
2. Read through the assignment parameters
3. Read and understand the given week two information
4. Compare given markdown language example with the markdown cheat sheet
5. Re read examples as need until an understanding has been reached


### Problems
My only issues regarding this weeks homework have revolved around learning and feeling comfortable with the grammar and syntax provided in the formatting instructions for the markdown text files. As I still don't feel completely comfortable with the language, I believe my problems lie mostly with my own confidence in the subject. I believe this is my only problem because of the fact that answers to my questions generally came with re reading the given information.


#### Further Discussion
I would appreciate a further discussion on the purpose and uses of the application Sourcetree. The process in which a student commits their work to github.com still confuses me.
I would also appreciate a more in depth discussion during class time about the fenced code block formatting and syntax.


##### Helping classmates
I have helped classmates in class this week in two ways.
- Firstly, I have repeated back prior explanations made by the instructor to classmates that had their attentions occupied while it had been said
- Secondly I have done my best to explain the purpose of all of the applications we have been using so far as well as how they connect with one another
In addition I have needed help from my classmates in understanding the "git" commands in the powershell
```
function test ()  {                                                                       
git status;
}
```
