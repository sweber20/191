# THIS WEEK
  I would say that this weeks project was one of the easier times I've had dealing with code. I had only one problem originally with where my background was ordered along with the other shapes I had used. Once I solved that problem creating a button was simple enough.

# DIFFICULTIES
  My first problem was that I had difficulty getting shapes to appear on the background after the button was pressed. My second difficulty was when I attempted to make the fill of the ellipses separate colors without interfering with the text button color. I would have liked for the ellipses to remain present on the after button screen and reset when the button was released but I could not figure out how to have the background not redraw without putting my entire code in set up function. I would like to make my product more advanced than my capabilities at the moment seem to allow.
