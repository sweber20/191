# HOMEWORK 3 RETOUCH
  I was able to retouch my HW-3 with function properties. I created two main functions to substitute the large amount of text out of the main draw function and into two different function sections called jeff and jeff2. These functions are mirror images of each other because jeff2 is designed to be the original jeff's shadow.

## INTENT
  my original idea was to create four different versions of jeff with all different fills but I later disregarded that idea because I could not make the background split into fourths along with the models of jeff so I decided to go with a different route and create a shadow as best as I could.
