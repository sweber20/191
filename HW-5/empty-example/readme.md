# My Initial Idea
  At first I was having a lot of difficulty incorporating math and algorithms into my work. As a result, I had tried watching the recommended help videos on the wiki page. After gaining a little better understanding through the help video I began to formulate my own plan for an artwork that changes over time.

## How My Plans Shifted
  I had begin to understand the commands that generate a random process by which dots appear and attempted to map out an area where shapes were confined to randomly generate within a canvass of 100 by 100. I was having difficulty making the shapes appear anywhere besides a central point and then changing dimensions around the point. I decided to change my plan again,
### End Result
  I'm still a little foggy in my understanding of how my code works but I had used a random generator for my height and width of the eyes of my robot face and decided to have the eyes constantly expanding both horizontally and vertically. The positon of the mouth never changes but the colors of the fills all resemble each other for a more unified feeling.
