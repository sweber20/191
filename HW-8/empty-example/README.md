#Overview
This was one of the more challenging assignments so far this semester. Even though my script has a very diverse amount of functions, and I'm proud of that, There is still much of what I've done that continues to confuse me to great extents.

##Confusion
these are the areas that confuse me the most.
Arrays: what they are and how they're applied.
Parentheses within functions: In general I do not understand.
