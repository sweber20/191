## HW-3 MONSTER

This week I have began to use the p5.js file structure to create a branch of text through the markdown language to create a visual in my browser index.

I used the basic 2D shapes provided in the references column on the p5.js website.
In total, I used the commands; ellipse, triangle, line, rect, createCanvas, fill, push, pop, and background.

When we began working in class, the only thing that confused me was how to make the line command either horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. Now I understand that to have a complete vertical or horizontal figure I must have either matching X coordinates or matching Y coordinates.

One question I had while completing my work was whether or not it was possible to take a rectangle and adjust it to be diagonal instead of either vertical or horizontal. I wanted to use a rectangle for my creatures legs instead of lines but the inability to rotate the shape made my decision pretty easy.

I also am having trouble uploading the sketch itself. I plan to ask question in class on Monday.
